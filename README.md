# Advanced Python
A collection of various advanced Python projects I have completed

## Sounds Good!
A Python 2.0 project that manipulates sound. It can:

- [x] Change the audio file's speed (make it slower or faster).
- [x] Swap the two halves of an audio file and playing the resultant audio file.
- [x] Reverse the sound by redefining the new sample rate and playing it in reverse.
- [x] Change the volume of the sound by multiplying the number of samples.
- [x] Overlap the audio with a controllable static noise.
- [x] Take two audio files (each with different sample rates) and layers them into a new .wav file to play them both together. This function also has the capability of controlling the scale factor (volume) of each sound, so one sound will play a little louder than the other.
- [x] Add an echo to the sound file by adding a time delay.
